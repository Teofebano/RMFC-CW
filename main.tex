\section{Motivation}
The startup ecosystem is a dynamic and complex arena where the flow of capital, innovation, and human resources intermingle to catalyze the growth of new enterprises. In this vibrant environment, the role of investor networks is paramount, not just as sources of funding but as crucial conduits for guidance, expertise, and industry connections. This research delves into the structural nuances of these networks, examining how their configuration influences the success trajectories of startups.

Investors (encompassing angels, venture capitalists, and corporate investors) naturally create a web of relationships that can significantly impact a startup’s access to resources, market entry, and competitive positioning. Unfortunately, despite the abundance of data in this particular network, less is understood about how the network aspects of these relationships—such as centrality and community structure—affect startup outcomes. This gap presents a critical area for exploration, particularly given the increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making in venture capital.

The scope of this project is to construct and analyze a detailed network model of these investor-startup relationships, revealing underlying patterns and behaviors that might contribute to startups' success. This information can thereby informing investment strategies and potentially guiding policy-making in economic hubs. This approach not only bridges an important research gap but also enhances the strategic frameworks within which venture capitalists operate.

This research is motivated by the potential to transform the conventional methods of startup evaluation and to offer a more nuanced understanding of how structural network properties can be leveraged to forecast and enhance startup viability and growth. By engaging with this topic, the study aims to contribute significantly to the academic discourse and provide actionable insights that could reshape investment strategies in the entrepreneurial landscape.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Despite the critical role of investor networks in the startup ecosystem and abundant data on investment amounts and funding rounds, there remains a significant gap in understanding how the specific structures and characteristics of these networks influence startup outcomes. Most current models focus predominantly on financial metrics or founder backgrounds, overlooking the broader network dynamics that can significantly influence startup success. This research aims to answer the question: How do the connectivity and characteristics of investor networks affect the growth trajectories and survival rates of startups? By limiting the investigation to these network characteristics, the research aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of how investor relationships within these networks directly correlate with startup growth and sustainability, thereby offering a foundational tool for strategic decision-making in the investment community.

\subsection{Research Hypothesis and Objectives}
This research investigates the hypothesis that the connectivity and characteristics of investor networks, specifically the centrality measures of investors and the structure of investment communities, significantly influence the growth trajectories and survival rates of startups. We hypothesize that startups linked to highly central investors within cohesive investment communities are likely to demonstrate higher growth rates and improved survival prospects.

There are five objectives in this research. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Construct a comprehensive network model of investor-startup relationships that incorporates quantitative investment data
    \item Analyze the centrality of investors within the network to assess how these measures correlate with the success metrics of funded startups
    \item Identify and analyze the structure of communities within the investor network to determine their impact on startup outcomes
    \item Examine the evolution of the investor-startup network over time, capturing dynamic changes and their effects on startup growth and survival
    \item Examine the evolution of the investor-startup network over time, capturing dynamic changes and their effects on startup growth and survival
\end{itemize}

The rationale behind this study is driven by the recognized importance of network effects in the startup ecosystem, where relationships dictate access to resources, knowledge, and opportunities. By understanding the structural attributes of investor networks, this research aims to provide critical insights into the mechanisms that foster startup success, offering a competitive edge to both investors and startups.

However, the study will not explore the qualitative aspects of investor-startup relationships, such as the quality of mentorship or the level of investor involvement, beyond their quantifiable impact through network structures. Furthermore, the focus will be primarily on quantifiable network metrics and their direct correlations, rather than on external factors like market conditions or technological innovations that could also significantly impact startup success.

\subsection{Timeliness and Novelty}

In the rapidly evolving business environment, understanding the network effects within the startup ecosystem is crucial, particularly the role of investor networks which have not been thoroughly explored. This research aims to fill this gap by examining how the structural properties of these networks impact startup outcomes, a study made timely by the increasing emphasis on social capital and network leverage in determining startup viability and success. While much of the existing research has focused on financial metrics and the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs, the structural dynamics of investor networks remain underexplored, presenting an opportunity to deepen both academic and practical understanding of their influence on business strategy and economic policy.

Moreover, as the venture capital and broader investment community move towards more data-driven decision-making, this research provides a novel perspective by focusing on structural network metrics. This approach promises to revolutionize how investors assess potential investments, enhancing their ability to identify promising startups and efficiently allocate resources. Additionally, the research empowers startups with insights on how to strategically position themselves within investor networks to maximize their chances of success. The proposed study is both timely and innovative, offering significant value to the academic community, startups, and investors, aligning perfectly with contemporary trends in economic strategies and technological advancements.

\subsection{Significance}

The proposed research stands out due to its innovative approach and significant practical implications, aimed at enriching the current understanding of startup success and investor networks. By shifting the focus from traditional financial metrics to the structural properties of investor networks, the study advances academic knowledge and offers actionable insights that could dramatically influence investment strategies and foster startup growth. This novel quantitative analysis explores how centrality and community structures within these networks impact startup outcomes, potentially leading to a reevaluation of social capital and network effect theories, while also guiding investors towards more effective decision-making practices.

Moreover, the research is pivotal as it addresses a critical gap in understanding the non-financial factors within startup ecosystems, providing a more comprehensive perspective on what drives startup success. This is particularly relevant in the context of today's data-driven decision-making trends. By highlighting key network metrics predictive of startup success, the study not only aids investors, especially venture capitalists, in refining their investment approaches but also sets the stage for further research into other influential factors such as international investment flows and the role of digital platforms. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing the strategic capabilities of investors and ensuring the sustainability of startups in competitive environments.

\subsection{Feasibility}

The feasibility of this research is grounded in the practicality of its methodology and the accessibility of its primary data source, the Crunchbase API, which provides a comprehensive and continuously updated dataset of startups, investors, and investment transactions. This data richness and availability significantly enhance the feasibility of conducting extensive network analyses within a constrained timeframe and with limited resources.

To ensure the study's feasibility before proceeding with major implementation work, a preliminary feasibility study will be conducted. This will involve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial tests will be run on the Crunchbase API to confirm the availability and integrity of the data required for the study, particularly regarding investor-startup relationships and investment details. This will help identify any potential data gaps or limitations in the API's scope
    \item An evaluation of the computational resources needed to process and analyze the data will be undertaken. This includes assessing the software and hardware requirements for handling large datasets and complex network analyses, ensuring that the necessary tools and capacities are in place
    \item A detailed timeline will be developed, outlining key milestones and deliverables. This will ensure that the project remains on track and within the allocated time, addressing potential bottlenecks or delays early in the process
\end{itemize}

By addressing these key aspects, the feasibility study aims to establish a solid foundation for the research, minimizing risks and ensuring that the study can be conducted effectively within its constraints. This preparatory phase is critical to guarantee that the full research project is practical, achievable, and capable of producing valuable insights within the limited timeframe and resources available.

\subsection{Beneficiaries}

This research is poised to benefit a wide range of stakeholders, particularly researchers in the fields of economic sociology, business studies, and data science, by providing a deeper understanding of how investor networks influence startup success. The findings will offer valuable insights into network effects and social capital, broadening the academic discourse around these topics and contributing to more nuanced theories in these areas. To ensure that these benefits are accessible, the research outcomes will be disseminated through multiple channels. Key findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals, ensuring rigorous review and wide academic reach. Additionally, results will be presented at relevant conferences, fostering direct engagement with other researchers and practitioners in the field. This will facilitate knowledge sharing and potentially inspire further research based on the findings. To enhance accessibility and foster further academic work, all datasets processed and analyzed during the study, subject to privacy and confidentiality constraints, will be made available in a public repository. Moreover, detailed methodologies and tools developed will be documented and published in open-access formats, allowing other researchers to replicate or build upon this work. Through these efforts, the research aims to not only advance understanding within its specific area but also support interdisciplinary work that intersects with network analysis, startup dynamics, and investment strategies.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Data Collection}
The primary method of data collection for this research involves utilizing the Crunchbase API, a comprehensive source of information about startups, including details about their investors, funding rounds, and other relevant data. This approach allows for systematic and scalable data extraction, ensuring that we capture a broad and detailed dataset encompassing various aspects of the startup ecosystem. Specifically, we will extract data on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Startups: Names, industry sectors, dates of establishment, funding histories, and current status (open deals, acquisitions, IPOs, etc.).
    \item Investors: Types (e.g., angel, venture capital), investment patterns, and network links to other investors and startups.
    \item Investment Transactions: Amounts, dates, and the sequence of funding rounds to trace the flow of capital within the network.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Result Interpretation}
To analyze and interpret the results, the research will focus on startups classified as "open deals"—those that have not yet received funding, been acquired, or been listed on the stock exchange. By examining these startups, the study aims to assess the predictive power of early-stage network metrics, specifically centrality and community structure, on long-term economic performance.

Generally, it will follow these five steps : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using the collected data, we will construct a network where nodes represent startups and investors, and edges represent investment relationships. The network will be analyzed over time to capture the dynamics of investor influence and startup development
    \item Calculate centrality measures for each startup in the network. This analysis will identify startups that, at an early stage, are centrally positioned within the investor network, hypothesizing that these startups are more likely to succeed
    \item Apply algorithms to detect communities within the network, assuming that startups within highly interconnected investor communities may have better access to resources and knowledge, contributing to their success
    \item Analyze startups' success based on whether, within a 7-year window from founding, startups achieve significant milestones such as acquiring other firms, being acquired, or completing an IPO
    \item Compare the early predictions based on network centrality and community detection with actual outcomes to evaluate the accuracy and predictive power of these network metrics
